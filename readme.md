# Compartment #

Compartment is part component manager, part dependency resolver, part package builder, all handled through a manifest file.
The manifest simply stores a list of components and their dependency on other components from the same manifest.
Compartment provides an easy mechanism to create custom packaging builds with resolution for data and file types.
