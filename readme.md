# Compartment #

Compartment is part dependency graph, part component manager, part package builder, all handled through a manifest file.
The manifest simply stores a list of components and their dependency on other components from the same manifest.
Compartment provides an easy mechanism to create custom packaging builds with resolution for file types, system paths, and requirements.
